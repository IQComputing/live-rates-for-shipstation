= 1.0.1 =

Relase Date: August 01, 2025

* Overview
	* Patches an issue where the individual requests method would not return their requests back to the shipping method.
		* Shoutout to .org user @dpkonofa for their assistance in debugging this issue!
	* Tries another method to discern ShipStation Core Carriers from Manually Connected Carriers using the `primary` carrier property.
		* ShipStation suggests the `balance` flag should be empty for Manually Connected Carriers, but we find that this is not always the case.

* Code Updates
	* \IQLRSS\Core\Shipping_Method_Shipstation::get_individual_requests() now returns it's request array.
	* \IQLRSS\Core\Shipstation_Api::get_carriers() `is_shipstation` value discerned using `primary` Carrier API property.
